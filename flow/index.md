# Welcome to Boomerang Flow ðŸ‘‹

Boomerang Flow is the easiest way to build, automate, and optimize workflows - without writing a single line of code... unless you really want to! With our fully extensible model, you can bring a script, bring a container, or write your own tasks from scratch.

Whether you're a solo operator or managing a team, our intuitive drag-and-drop builder helps you streamline repetitive tasks, integrate with your favourite tools, and ensure everything runs smoothly.

Create workflows composed of reusable logic that you define, using our tasks for automatically retriable steps and human-in-the-loop flows using actions or wait for event.

## Why use Boomerang Flow?

âœ… Automate with Ease â€“ Build workflows visually without coding. Just drag, drop, and connect.

âœ… Powerful Integrations â€“ Connect with any APIs effortlessly.

âœ… Reliable Execution â€“ Runs are queued and reliably executed to ensure stability.

âœ… Flexible Triggers â€“ Start workflows manually, on a schedule, via API, or from event-driven sources.

âœ… Scalable & Secure â€“ Designed for teams and enterprises with access control, logging, and monitoring.

âœ… Detailed Runs & Insights â€“ View each workflow run in detail, including logs, execution history, and step-by-step progress for easy troubleshooting.

âœ… Fully Extensible â€“ Bring your own task using the open-source Tekton.dev model or write custom code packaged as a BYO container.
