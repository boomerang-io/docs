# Custom Agents

Agents are a powerful way to extend the capabilities of Flow. They allow you to create custom logic and functionality that can be triggered by workflows and tasks.

The connection of an Agent to Flow is established through a long poll queue endpoint.

## Agent Registration

To register an Agent, you need to create a new Agent in Flow. This can be done through the Flow UI or by using the API.
