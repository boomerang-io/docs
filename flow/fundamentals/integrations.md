# Integrations _beta_

Integrations supercharge your Workflows by seamlessly connecting with your favourite tools, apps, services, and APIs.

Whether you're automating everyday tasks, triggering workflows based on external events, or streamlining processes across platforms, integrations make automation easy, secure, and powerful.

Integrations fall into three main categories;

- **Trigger** â€“ Start workflows automatically when events occur externally.
- **Task** â€“ Securely manage reusable parameters for your tasks.
- **Platform** â€“ Control your workflows directly from external platforms.

## Trigger Integrations âš¡

Trigger Integrations automatically kick off your workflows based on events in other platforms or services.

### GitHub

Connect your GitHub organization effortlessly through a dedicated GitHub App. Automatically trigger workflows when events like pull requests or issues occurâ€”saving time, reducing manual work, and keeping everything in sync.

#### Example Use-cases:

- Run workflows whenever a pull request is opened or merged.
- Automatically notify teams about critical issue updates.

## Task Integrations ðŸ”‘

Task Integrations enable you to securely store parameters at the team level, making them easily accessible across multiple workflows and teams.

### Why Use Task Integrations?

- Promote parameter reusability, reducing duplication and potential errors.

## Platform Integrations ðŸš€

Platform Integrations enable external applications to directly manage and control your workflows. These integrations turn your favorite platforms into powerful automation hubs.

### Slack
