# Getting Started

After gaining access, users will be presented with the Home screen showing your teams, and allowing you to create a new team.

Once you have a team you can start creating Workflows using the **Create a new Workflow** tile on the Workflows screen. This opens a modal that allows you to **Start from scratch** or **Import a Workflow**.

## Team Creation

Teams can be created in two ways:

1. By any user through the UI.
2. Via the API.

## Workflow Templates

You can also click the **Templates** button in the top right and create a workflow from Template. This is a great way to get started with proven workflows.

## Need help?

Select **?** in the top right corner of any page in the application to enable contextual help.
