# Boomerang documentation repository

This repository contains the documentation Markdown source files for [useboomerang/docs](https://useboomerang.io/docs).

The `main` branch will be automatically accessible along with any releases.

## Design

This Markdown metadata is used to generate the documentation site. The metadata is used to generate the table of contents, breadcrumbs, and other navigation elements.

This is based on the [Remix Docs Template](https://github.com/boomerang-io/remix-docs-template?tab=readme-ov-file#content) and its content requirements.
